MARP
====

**MARP** (multi-agent route planning) is a Python testbed to facilitate research
in both multi-agent search and multi-agent learning.
More specifically,
we provide `PettingZoo-style <https://pettingzoo.farama.org/>`_ multi-agent environments
for multi-agent RL,
as well as model-based APIs for investigating efficient multi-agent search algorithms.
